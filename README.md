Where code stops being numbers and becomes meaning.

DragonRSense is a Visual Studio Code extension built specifically for
DragonRuby Game Toolkit, focused on making coordinates, sizes, and
basic code structures clear and understandable.

### Basic Snippets
- [x] `dr-sprite` → Base sprite

## 🧠 Philosophy

> First understand.  
> Then optimize.  
> Then scale.

DragonRSense does not try to do everything at once.
It focuses on doing the **right things first**.
